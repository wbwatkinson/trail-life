<details><summary>What is Trail Life?</summary>
	A ministry for the development of Christian leadership and character through outdoor adventure. Our goal is to create “ministry moments” which are then maximally used for Christian discipleship. Those ministry moments are created through opportunities of troop meetings and Hit the Trail! activities. We are less interested in teaching boys fishing than to be fishers of men; less interested in teaching boys to pitch tents than to expand the tent of God’s kingdom; less interested in teaching boys to scale mountain peaks than to know, in all difficulties, physical or spiritual, from where their help comes. But in all of these, the former is a means to achieve the latter.
